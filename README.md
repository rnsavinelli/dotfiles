## For most configuration files

Every file in this repository goes inside the 'user' folder except for the ones inside the 'others' folder.

In the future a script could be developed to automate this process.

## Other configuration files

blacklist.conf goes inside /etc/modprobe.d/

grub goes inside /etc/default

index.theme goes inside /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme

geoclue.conf goes inside /etc/geoclue/geoclue.conf
