## For most configuration files

Every file in this repository goes inside the `user` folder except for the ones inside the `others` folder.

In the future a script could be developed to automate this process.

## Other configuration files

blacklist.conf goes inside /etc/modprobe.d/

grub goes inside /etc/default
